                        Wars of tomorrow will look quite different from those of the past and present. The visual of foot soldiers marching on battlegrounds and living in barracks will soon be material for history textbooks. Future wars will be fought with unmanned drones maneuvered by soldiers who grew up playing video games, sitting in a distant control room in front of screens displaying the battlefield. The same high-definitions screens will display the fiery aftermath of deploying weapons from those drones. Such a drone can be seen dropping a bomb in the photograph below. At the end of such a “working day”, these soldiers will go home to spend time with their families and maybe play video games with their kids to relax. Although technology has already made inroads into this territory and continues its resolute march towards making this a reality, the ethical considerations languish behind, struggling to catch up.<strong>image</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the latest developments in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and neural networks, the world has been left fumbling for corresponding ethics to arrive upon unified morals these programs should abide by. However, the media fueled hype for AI has caused ethical discussions of drones to dwarf in the shadow of their insentient controllers. Movies like The Terminator paint vivid pictures of a future of intelligent robot gone rogue. They catapult the discussion on ethics past the intermediate stage of remotely manned weapons that can be operated by video-game-like interfaces. Of course, we will have to address the ethical aspects of using artificial intelligence in war. However, we might not be around to witness it if we destroy ourselves before we reach that point in technological advancement. In this article, I hope to rectify this possible oversight ever so slightly, by outlining the normative ethical arguments found in my own exploration of the topic of remote warfare.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will be analyzing drones from the perspective of normative ethics, which attempts to describe how people should act by defining various systems by assigning value to a decision. Here the decision I will be evaluating the ethical considerations for, is that of using remotely operated drones what have an interface that looks and functions like video games, for the purpose of waging wars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To clarify, my argument is not about war. Rather, it is about the instrumentation used in war. What is the value, or lack thereof, of the decision to use drones to wage war? Though most philosophical stances propose that war in any form is wrong, my writing will adopt the axiom that war is inevitable and will simply attempt to determine the ramifications of using video games in war. I would like to emphatically state that it is my sincere belief that there is always an alternative to war. However, the history of human beings sadly reminds us that we don’t always look for those alternatives hard enough. In my arguments, traditional warfare will be used as a baseline to compare aspects of this new mode of waging war. Is playing out war like a videogame just as bad, or is it perhaps worse than fighting a tradition war?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before I delve into my analysis, I would like to make another disclaimer. I am not anti-video-games. It is a form of entertainment just like the books and the movies. The content of video games is what differentiates the innocuous from the insidious. All through this article, when video games are mentioned, the reference is to the weapons used for killing and destruction of property that have a user interface that looks and feels like a video game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final clarification on scope I would like to provide is regarding the treatment of video games in my article. There is material galore on the connection between video games and aggression in their players. There are spirited arguments on both sides about whether there is a causation relation between the two. I am not adding to that conversation. I am exploring the use of video games to perpetrate violence. In this respect, my reference to video games narrowly addresses the ethical considerations of using equipment using which feels like playing video games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are several negative attributes unique to such a use of video games. Some are obvious. Most people understand that using video games in war introduces an emotional distance. However, most of them attribute this emotional distance to the physical distance of the perpetrator from the victim – since the bomb is being dropped on a foreign country, it is okay, because my family and friends and I are not being impacted. Commonly overlooked is the concept of mechanical distance. 
                    </p>
                    <h1><strong>What is Mechanical Distance and Why Does it Matter?</strong></h1>
                    <p>
                        Mechanical distance is categorized by the screen separating the gamer from the game. The actual event could be happening in close physical proximity to the player. The philosopher who explored this idea believed that even if the physical distance between the UAV crew and the location of the strike was reduced, the screen itself would provide the emotional distance. Much like how, at a zoo, the glass between yourself and the enclosure eliminates most fear of being attacked by the animal within. The only requirement is for the barrier to keep out the danger. In this way, mechanical distance is different from physical distance in the way our brains process it. Another psychologist believed that the emotional distance of videogames is chosen by the gamer and stems from a suspension of disbelief. This makes the use of drones more akin to that of a ride on a roller coaster, than a trip to the zoo. The participants choose to be afraid even when the threat of harm is known to be an illusion. This begs the question: how does that self-induced fear compare to that of the fear felt “naturally” in the presence of true and imminent danger? Does subconsciously knowing there is no real danger play a part in turning the knob on fear to the optimal level? Needs Explaining Similar questions can be asked about guilt. Is the guilt felt by harming someone a choice? Can it be coaxed in one direction or the other by introducing barriers?
                    </p>
                    <h1><strong>Guilt and the Screen: A Complicated Relationship</strong></h1>
                    <p>
                        One of the deterrents of war is the guilt felt upon killing and critics of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) argue that they alleviate guilt by allowing the controller to compartmentalize their worlds into the physical one they live in, and the digital one they work in. At first glance this logic appears sound. Take for instance a movie. The death of an extra in the movie likely would not affect you as much as watching a stranger die in real life. You have the same initial connection to both characters (none) but your subsequent reaction would be vastly different. Why? Because the screen divides your reality and separates you from the character. The counter argument for this stance is the fact that UAV crews have been known to suffer from post-traumatic stress.  “Reports of drone crews suffering from post-traumatic stress induced by constant exposure to high-resolution images of real-time killing and the after-action inventory of body parts should be taken extremely seriously” (lindlaw) How could this be possible if there mechanical distance separates them from the victims? In “A View to Kill” the authors describe, “One Predator pilot insists that the horror of watching two young boys on a bicycle ride into the frame seconds before his missile struck its designated target ‘lost none of its impact’ from being viewed on a screen: ‘Death observed was still death’”(Martin 2010, Predator -> (Gregory). Knowing that those were real kids caused the same trauma irrespective of whether the killing was done remotely or in person. Or does it? Can just the fact that there was trauma be used to equate the impact of both methods? There is not gauge to measure the impact on a scale, but there is no denying that there is an impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such an effect can be witnessed outside the context of war. And so naturally, the internet has no dearth of gory videos that can be used to test this theory. One such internet community, the sub-Reddit r/watchpeopledie, actually used this effect as a basis to form the community. The members include police officers, workers in the Emergency Medical Services and fire departments that wish to ready themselves to the horrors of trauma. These are videos of real people in real situations. If you with to test this on yourself, the following is among the top videos on the site. Note: the content is graphic and viewer discretion is highly advised.  For those who do not wish to view the video, here is a brief description of the content. It shows a man being pulled out of a crushed vehicle accident. His chest has undergone so much damage that the heart is visible and can be seen beating: <a href="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SilkyScornfulBlackfootedferret-mobile.mp4">https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SilkyScornfulBlackfootedferret-mobile.mp4</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is hard to view the video and not have an adverse reaction. Shouldn’t the mechanical distance provided by the screen have given you an emotional shield? Compare this video with the never-ending bloody scenes one sees in movies and TV shows. We watch them while eating, bonding with family and playing games. Some of the more graphic ones my make us turn away but the emotional response is nowhere near the one felt while watching the video of the real trauma. So it could be argued that the mechanical shield is does not fully shield you from the guilt of perpetrating violence but does somewhat, in some cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In some cases, violence on video does provoke the same visceral reaction as in real life, while it does not in others. What really distinguishes a video that provokes a reaction from one that induces yawns? The realization that the visual is conveying a real event is likely what separates the two. People who align themselves with this philosophical stance, believe that individuals without prior knowledge that the actors on the big screen are alright, and the “baddies” of a video game are simply simulated, would feel an equal amount of guilt upon watching these scenes as watching the event unfold in real life. So it could be argued by some that, so long as the operators of war equipment know that they are causing real damage, their use will not result in significant increase in violence. This belief, however, does not guarantee a support for UAV warfare.
                    </p>
                    <h1><strong>The Risk of Big Brother</strong></h1>
                    <p>
                        Could soldiers be tricked into believing they are playing a game while waging a real war? Video simulations are used regularly by the armed forces to prepare their soldiers for combat. If these soldiers were told that they are participating in yet another simulation but if the simulation was rigged to control real weapons, the soldiers would feel no guilt. This concept is the main idea behind the populate dystopian novel, Enders Game. It depicts a futuristic society in which the protagonist is undergoing military training. All his training is delivered using simulations that look like large screen video games. The social structure of the training center is also design similar to video game competition. The In this story’s climax, the protagonist participates in what he was told was a war simulation for training. He later finds that he has obliterated an entire civilization in the process. All through the exercise, his adrenaline rush eggs him on. All he feels is the thrill of a chase and win. His remorse only kicks in when the truth is revealed. Though the futuristic society of Enders Game is merely a distant possibility today, more rudimentary versions of it could successfully be executed with current technology. Moral philosophers have been quick to emphasize this risk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even if the soldiers were told that they were fighting a real war but the visuals were abstracted would they feel guilty? For example, if the user interface was made to look like say, the game Minesweeper, and the soldiers were not told or shown the true locations, or the extent of damage caused, they are not likely to feel guilt to the same extent. This type of argument is where UAV’s and AI meet. Opponents of AI target the technology instead of blaming its potential misuse. The same is true with opponents of UAVs. Consequentialism. However, if there is a way, we need not wait long for someone with a will to crawl out of the woodwork. 
                    </p>
                    <h1><strong>Video Games: A Form of Violence?</strong></h1>
                    <p>
                        While the topic of whether video games encourage violence and aggression has been thoroughly explored, the ethics of their potential use as a form of violence itself is yet to be fully analyzed.  Extending the aforementioned consequentialism, video games could indeed be considered a form of violence simply because they run the risk of being used as such. This medium lends itself to ample ways to combat guilt. Mechanical distance is inherent in the nature of video games. Even if it does not fully obliterate guilt, it at least assuages it to an extent. Knowing that the damage done is real does help in curtailing violence to some extent, however, just the existence of the technology is sufficient to entice someone to construct an environment where the perpetrators are unaware of the true consequences of their action. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The lure of creating such weapons lies in the atavistic urge to protect our own. We can do so by neutralizing a threat to our safety while not putting our own in harms way. However, once the technology is developed, then the other side can also have it. The same inclination towards violence will act in the opposite direction. Fortunately, at least as of today, it takes considerable funding to build such weapons. Although escalating aggression from fear and the arms race is not the topic of this article, I hope the ethical considerations discussed here help a little in urging decision makers to take a hard look at funding video-game-like weapons.
